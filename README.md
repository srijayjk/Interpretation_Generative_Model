# Interpretation_Generative_Model
This repo contains the project done in Fachpraktikum for Machine Learning and Computer Vision for HCI.
The repo contains files related to 3 different implementations with different configuration of Variational AutoEncoder with Grad_CAM.

## Towards Visually Explaining Variational Autoencoders.

Our work is based on the paper mentioned here.

The Grad_CAM is implemented on Variational AutoEncoder model. The model is trained on Celeb_A_MaskHQ dataset.
